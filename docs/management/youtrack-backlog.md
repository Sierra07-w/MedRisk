# YouTrack Task Backlog — MedRisk

**Purpose:** import-ready backlog.
**Project:** [medrisk.youtrack.cloud/projects/DIP](https://medrisk.youtrack.cloud/projects/DIP) — created;
**all 46 tasks imported on 19 Oct 2026** (automated: `scripts/youtrack_import.py`, manual: guide below).
The script is idempotent — re-run it after editing the CSV to keep YouTrack in sync.
Verified: IDs run DIP-1 … DIP-46 in table order, and state, priority, milestone and
due date match the CSV for every issue.

> **Note on assignees:** the YouTrack *Assignee* field accepts users only, so the four
> `Team` rows (DIP-6, DIP-10, DIP-41, DIP-44) are assigned to the coordinating lead
> (Muslim, login `admin`); DIP-43 (supervisor review) is left unassigned — the
> supervisor has no YouTrack account yet.

## How to import the backlog into YouTrack (step by step)

> Works for youtrack.cloud and self-hosted YouTrack 2023+. Admin rights or project-admin
> rights are required for steps 1–3.

**Step 1 — Create the project**
1. YouTrack → `+ New` (or Administration → Projects → `+`) → **Create Project**.
2. Name: `MedRisk`. **ID prefix: `DIP`** — this is important: branch and commit names in
   Git use these IDs (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
3. Workflow: choose one whose states are close to `To do → In Progress → Done`
   (this is the workflow the DIP project actually uses — the import relies on these
   exact option names).

**Step 2 — Prepare fields and users**
1. Invite the team first: Administration → Users → `+`. The project uses the accounts
   `admin` (Muslim), `zarinakosaman9` (Zarina) and `mukhammadsara07` (Sara) — the password
   reset e-mail addresses are not kept in the repository, which is **public**. Otherwise the
   *Assignee* column will not map (YouTrack matches by login/e-mail).
2. Custom field **Milestone** (for the `M0…M6` column): project settings →
   **Custom Fields** → `+` → type **State field** (or Text) → name `Milestone`,
   attach to issue type *Issue*.
3. Check that **Priority** (Critical/Major/Normal/Minor) and **State**
   (To do/In Progress/Done) already exist in the project workflow —
   CSV values must match the existing option names exactly.

**Step 3 — Import the CSV**
1. Administration → **Import Data from Other Tracker** → `+ Create Import Configuration`.
2. Format: **CSV**. Upload `docs/management/youtrack-import.csv` from the repository.
   Delimiter: comma. Encoding: UTF-8. (Dates are already in `YYYY-MM-DD`.)
3. Map the columns:
   | CSV column | YouTrack field |
   |---|---|
   | Summary | Summary |
   | Description | Description |
   | Assignee | Assignee |
   | Priority | Priority |
   | State | State |
   | Milestone | Milestone (custom field from step 2) |
   | Due date | Due Date |
4. **Preview** the first rows → check mapping → **Import**.

**Step 4 — Verify**
1. The CSV is sorted by ID, so a fresh `DIP` project numbers the issues **DIP-1 … DIP-46**
   in exactly this order. Check that issue numbers match the table (DIP-44 = interviews,
   DIP-45 = YouTrack setup, DIP-46 = GitHub push).
2. If the numbering is off (e.g. a test issue was created before the import), fix it
   *before* the team starts branching: Administration → Projects → DIP → **ID** →
   change the number of the next issue, delete the mismatched issues and re-import.
3. Add the project link to the root `README.md` (section «Task tracking») and commit.

**Manual fallback:** if import is not possible, create tasks from the table below —
46 tasks, fields: summary, description with acceptance criteria, assignee, priority,
state, milestone, due date. Order does not matter then.

Suggested project settings:
- **Project name:** MedRisk, **ID prefix:** `DIP`
- **States:** To do → In Progress → Done
- **Priorities:** Critical / Major / Normal / Minor
- Custom fields: `Milestone` (M0…M6)

Rules: every task has an assignee, an acceptance criterion and a deadline; the task ID goes
into the branch name and the commit/PR title (`DIP-12: …`). A task is Done only when its
acceptance criteria are met.
